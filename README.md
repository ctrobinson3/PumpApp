<h1>Pump App Read-Me</h1>
This app is intended for use by firefighters working on learning pump calculations and pump theory. The program allows for the user to add multiple discharges, hoses, and nozzles, with choices of diameter, nozzle type, and lengths.

The program uses pump coefficients and equations used from IFSTA and will automatically input the answers once all nozzles have been placed.

You are able to choose between smooth bore and fog. Smooth bore gives you the option to use either GPM or PSI at the nozzle and will convert the other value based off of the Smooth Bore GPM calculation.

Equations:
<br>
Friction Loss: FL = CQL
<br>
Smooth Bore GPM: 29.7 * D^2 * sqrt(np)
<br>
Smooth Bore PSI: ((GPM/29.7)/d^2)^2
